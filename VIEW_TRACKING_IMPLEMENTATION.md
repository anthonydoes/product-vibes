# View Tracking Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of unique view tracking for products in the Product Vibes application.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Session-Based Unique View Tracking
- Each product view is tracked only once per browser session per product
- Uses `sessionStorage` to store viewed products with key `viewed_product_{productId}`
- Prevents artificial inflation of view counts from page refreshes or repeated visits

### 2. Creator Self-View Blocking
- Product creators do not generate view counts when viewing their own products
- Implemented by comparing `userId` with `creator_id` in the `incrementProductViews` method
- Helps maintain accurate view metrics by excluding creator self-views

### 3. Real Database Integration
- Uses Supabase's `increment_product_views` database function
- Updates both `products.view_count` and inserts records into `product_views` table
- Maintains consistency between aggregated counts and detailed view logs

## Implementation Details

### Modified Files

#### `src/services/productService.ts`
- Updated `incrementProductViews` method signature to accept `creatorId` parameter
- Added creator comparison logic to skip view counting for product owners
- Maintained existing session-based deduplication logic

#### `src/components/ProductPage.tsx`
- Updated call to `incrementProductViews` to pass current user ID and product creator ID
- View tracking occurs when a product page is loaded

### Logic Flow

1. **User visits product page** → ProductPage.tsx loads product data
2. **Check if user is creator** → Compare `user.id` with `product.creator_id`
3. **Skip if creator** → Return early without incrementing views
4. **Check session storage** → Look for `viewed_product_{productId}` key
5. **Skip if already viewed** → Return early if session key exists
6. **Track view** → Call database function and set session key
7. **Handle errors** → Remove session key if database call fails

## Database Schema

### Products Table
- `creator_id`: UUID referencing profiles.id (foreign key)
- `view_count`: Integer tracking total product views

### Product Views Table
- Records individual view events with user and timestamp information
- Used for detailed analytics and today's view calculations

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Metrics**: View counts reflect genuine user interest, not creator activity
2. **Prevents Gaming**: Session-based tracking prevents artificial inflation
3. **Real-time Updates**: Database functions ensure immediate consistency
4. **Detailed Tracking**: Maintains both aggregate counts and detailed logs

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Creator Test**: Login as product creator and verify views don't increment
2. **Session Test**: Refresh product page multiple times, verify only one view counted
3. **Guest Test**: View products without login, verify views are counted
4. **Multiple Users**: Test with different user accounts viewing same product

## Future Enhancements

1. **IP-based Tracking**: Add IP address to prevent cross-session gaming
2. **Time-based Windows**: Implement daily unique views instead of session-based
3. **Analytics Dashboard**: Build detailed view analytics for creators
4. **Bot Detection**: Add user-agent analysis to filter bot traffic
