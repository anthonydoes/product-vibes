# Fixed Submission Issues

## ‚úÖ Issues Resolved

### 1. Dialog Accessibility Warning
- **Problem**: Missing `DialogDescription` component causing React warnings
- **Fix**: Added `DialogDescription` import and component to provide proper accessibility

### 2. Storage Upload Error (403 Unauthorized)
- **Problem**: "new row violates row-level security policy" 
- **Root Cause**: Storage bucket exists but missing proper RLS policies
- **Fix**: Created `/STORAGE_FIX.md` with step-by-step instructions

### 3. Better Error Handling
- **Added**: Upload error display in the submission form
- **Added**: Clear error messages pointing to storage setup guide
- **Added**: Error clearing when retrying submission

## üöÄ Quick Storage Fix

**Option 1: Use Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)**
1. Go to Storage ‚Üí product-assets ‚Üí Policies
2. Create these two policies:

**Policy 1: Allow authenticated uploads**
- Operation: `INSERT`
- Definition: `(bucket_id = 'product-assets') AND (auth.role() = 'authenticated')`

**Policy 2: Allow public reads**  
- Operation: `SELECT`
- Definition: `bucket_id = 'product-assets'`

**Option 2: Run SQL**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'product-assets' AND 
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

CREATE POLICY "Allow public reads" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'product-assets');
```

## üîç How to Test

1. **Run storage setup**: Follow `/STORAGE_FIX.md` instructions
2. **Try uploading**: Submit a product with logo and images
3. **Check for errors**: Any storage errors will now show helpful messages
4. **Verify storage**: Check Supabase Storage dashboard for uploaded files
