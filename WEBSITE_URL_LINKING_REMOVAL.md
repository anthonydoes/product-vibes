# Product Card Website URL Linking Removal

## Overview
Successfully removed external website URL linking from product cards in the ProductGrid component to improve user flow and keep users engaged within the platform.

## Problem
Previously, product titles in the product grid were clickable external links that would take users away from the platform to the product's website. This created a poor user experience because:

1. **Users left the platform** instead of viewing the product page
2. **Reduced engagement** with product details and community features
3. **Missed opportunities** for users to see product information, comments, and related products
4. **Inconsistent navigation** - clicking a card sometimes went to the product page, sometimes to external sites

## Solution
Removed the conditional external linking from product titles in the ProductGrid component so that:

1. **All product card clicks** now navigate to the internal product page (`/product/:slug`)
2. **External website access** is only available from the dedicated "Visit Website" button on the product page
3. **Consistent user experience** across all product interactions

## Changes Made

### ProductGrid.tsx
**Before:**
```tsx
{product.website_url ? (
  <a 
    href={product.website_url} 
    target="_blank" 
    rel="noopener noreferrer" 
    className="flex items-center gap-2 hover:text-primary transition-colors group/link"
    onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}
  >
    <h3 className="font-semibold text-base sm:text-lg text-foreground group-hover/link:text-primary transition-colors truncate">
      {product.name}
    </h3>
    <ExternalLink className="h-3 w-3 sm:h-4 sm:w-4 flex-shrink-0 opacity-0 group-hover/link:opacity-100 transition-all" />
  </a>
) : (
  <h3 className="font-semibold text-base sm:text-lg text-foreground truncate">{product.name}</h3>
)}
```

**After:**
```tsx
<h3 className="font-semibold text-base sm:text-lg text-foreground truncate">{product.name}</h3>
```

**Additional cleanup:**
- Removed unused `ExternalLink` import from lucide-react

## User Experience Impact

### Before (Poor UX)
1. User clicks on product card
2. If product has website URL: User is taken away from platform to external site
3. If no website URL: User goes to product page
4. **Inconsistent behavior** and **lost users**

### After (Improved UX)
1. User clicks on product card
2. **Always** navigates to internal product page (`/product/:slug`)
3. User can view product details, comments, related products
4. **External website access** available via dedicated "Visit Website" button
5. **Consistent, predictable behavior**

## Benefits

1. **Higher Engagement**: Users stay on the platform to explore product details
2. **Better Analytics**: Platform can track user behavior and product views
3. **Improved Discovery**: Users see related products and community features
4. **Consistent UX**: All product cards behave the same way
5. **Controlled External Navigation**: Website visits are intentional via dedicated button

## Files Modified
- `/src/components/ProductGrid.tsx` - Removed external URL linking from product titles

## Testing
- ✅ Product cards now consistently navigate to product pages
- ✅ No more unexpected external navigation from product grid
- ✅ External website access still available from product page "Visit Website" button
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Hot module replacement working correctly

## Future Considerations
- The external website URL is still stored and displayed properly on individual product pages
- Analytics can now better track the user journey from discovery to product page to external website
- Consider adding hover states or tooltips to indicate internal navigation vs external links
